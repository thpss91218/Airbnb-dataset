# Airbnb-dataset

## Abstract
The main goal of this Airbnb project is to find out the association between the average monthly reviews and characteristics that are available in a public dataset. These characteristics include aspects such as location, borough, and price. Based on the attributes of the dataset, three popular machine learning algorithms - logistic regression, decision tree, and random decision forest were chosen for this project. 

This paper contains a systematic approach at each step starting from the selection of decision variables, to the fitting process to the resultant model formations. Out of three chosen models, the decision tree method achieved the highest predictive accuracy with decent interpretability. From cross referencing across all the methods and after conducting in-depth analysis we can conclude that title of the listing, availability, price, and minimum nights required are the most important factors in predicting a better monthly review performance.
